# Things your mom does not like

## Description

Home is where you live, you better keep home clean. Especially if you have a mother who is scrupulous!
Your mom is arriving shortly and there are `5` things in your room which she hates seeing around.
Try to get them out of sight as soon as possible. `Things Your Mom Does Not Like` is a find the `hidden objects game`.
There are `30` things of your room and every play-through you are expected to find 5 of them and complete the game. The objects to be found are displayed as silhouettes at the bottom of the screen.

## Why we made dis?

Sercan's flight was delayed and Alper was recovering from the flu that he caught last week.
We looked for a perfect spot, where our laptops can connect the Wi-Fi. Tasty Ratsherrn beer made finding ideas easy at the beginning, but later on we started to feel sleepy.

I wasn't even aware that this game genre -hidden object games- existed! As Sercan said, I have to play more games.

Well, submitting this one is better than submitting nothing :d

## How we made dis?

The clash of ideas started even before we found our perfect spot for development. Walking through the corridor multiple times supplied the blood flow to our brains... Well, not really. We basically wanted to finish dis ASAP and have fun. After some time he's put the "kaputt" drawing tablet aside and made it with good old mouse.

## Disclaimer

The code is very shit, don't inspect it just play the game and get out of here.
